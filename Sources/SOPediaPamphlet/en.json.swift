During the first eons of their existence they could have been mistaken as a small clouds drifting around their prehistoric world.  Over time the clouds grew and multiplied.  It wasn’t until their numbers swelled significantly that they formed the first intelligent thought.\n\nThe more the Vass grew and multiplied the more intelligent they became.  Eventually, they formed a communal consciousness, a shared intelligence.  After countless more millennia this developed into one of the most refined intellects in the known universe.\n\nThis intellect eventually pointed them to the stars.  Unaware of the limitations of their shared intelligence the Vass sent ships to explore the cosmos.  These explorations proved to be disastrous.  Once the venturing Vass traveled past the range of their shared intellect they rapidly grew confused and simpleminded, unable to perform any function that required higher-level intelligence.  Essentially crewless husks, these first ships still drift across the endless cosmos.\n\nUsing their shared intellect the Vass developed new ships, built from a crystalline element found on their home world.  These new designs, coupled with the natural properties of the crystal, allowed even the smallest vessel to carry enough Vass to maintain their intelligence.  When their foraying ships discovered alien life the horde became known as the to the universe as Vass Collective.\n\nInitially having no discernable leadership, the Collective concluded it needed a single being to lead them and interact with its neighbors.  It was the single-greatest problem the Collective had ever contemplated, and the solution came only after great struggle.  The answer redefined the way their race would forever look at themselves.\n\nOver a million of the eldest members of the Collective permanently linked their minds and melded their bodies into one, sacrificing their own lives for the greater good of the Vass.  The result was Eesathu, a member of the Collective and yet a Collective all by itself.  Able to function at the highest levels of intelligence while completely isolated, Eesathu became the leader the Vass needed.  He is their spokesperson, guide, and guardian.   And, to some Vass, a savior, pointing the way they must travel for further enlightenment.\n\nUnited as never before under its leadership, the Vass Collective has set out to expand and explore the galaxy.  Willing to live in peaceful harmony the Vass will accept new members into their fellowship, knowing they will become greater for the added thoughts.  But they will not let any race stop the expansion of the Collective.  And with their unified mind and unprecedented leader it will take a collective effort to stop them.","tech_short_shipHullFrigate.md":"Unlocks the ability to design and build frigate class starships.","tech_short_pacifistsOverhaul2.md":"Provides an additional system slot to all hull designs in your empire.","race_short_robustTechies.md":"20% of Research is bonus Industry  \nThis race of brawny nerds enjoys the practical application of scientific research in every day life.

He was disinherited by his wealthy family, and was never mentioned again in their house.  First serving on small ships during anti-smuggling operations Gentry was soon recognized as a keen tactician and excellent battle-manager.  He progressed rapidly up the ranks, and was chosen to command the Confederacy’s first Mammoth class ship.  But when offered a spot at the Navy’s Tactical and Strategic War College he refused; his crew had become his new family, and he wouldn’t leave them.\n\nDespite staying a captain, Gentry’s forceful personality and influence is no small thing.  He has seen action in almost every battle of the confederation, and he and his ship have become living legends in the confederacy, used to sign up and inspire countless new recruits.  His skills, highly experienced crew, and ship modifications make him a deadly threat to anyone unlucky enough to be his enemy.","tech_short_improvedStarDrive4.md":"An anti-matter powered star drive will allow your ships to travel 9 parsecs each turn.","unexplored_star10.md":"Class F stars the most numerous of the blue-white stars.

While she would prefer to live untouched by the universe around her, at peace in her underground kingdom, she knows to do so would only invite extinction.  To ensure her children spread across the galaxy she is willing to lend her knowledge to those who know how to ask for it.\n\nAn expert in reproduction, even in other species, she knows what it takes to successfully raise young ones.

Tyrrhenius was the most famous and successful smuggler and pilot the Confederation ever had the privilege, and displeasure, of encountering.  Massive ship augmentations gave his renegade fleet increased range and unlimited cloaking, letting him make “fun runs” past blockading fleets undetected.  His physical augmentations are no less impressive.  By replacing large parts of his body with cybernetic implants Tyrrhenius is able to interface directly with his ship as never before, greatly increasing its handling in combat.\n\nWhen Tyrrhenius was finally tracked down and cornered by Captain Jack Gentry he was given three choices; he could be annihilated, spend the rest of his life in prison, or he could work for the Confederation.  Today, Tyrrhenius is one of humanity’s most ruthless commanders, threatening the rear of an enemy fleet with attacks they never imagine are coming.  But he is, first and foremost, out for himself, and will always sign up for a tour of “fun runs” with any empire willing to pay his fee.

Though his comrades derided him as a coward he held true to his beliefs, even as his words came back to haunt him.  When his fellow admirals, eager for blood on their claws, charged into the largest fleet battle the Federation had ever fought Kzzt held true to his beliefs and kept his command at extreme range.  Pouring thousands of missiles into the enemy, while dodging hundreds of return salvos, Kzzt’s and his command were the battle’s only survivors.\n\nAs the highest-ranking military officer left in the Federation, Kzzt allied his people with the Draske Hegemony.  Continuing to study missiles and extended-envelop warfare Kzzt has perfected his long-distance strategy.  Now, using only racial Draske as his pilots, coupled with his intense understanding of long-range engagements, makes him a deadly threat that cannot be ignored on the battlefield.","unexplored_star13.md":"Class M stars glare red and dim in the night sky.

Others, like Colonel Hanifer, are forged in a single moment.  When the Confederacy Navy first fought its first extra solar battle it felt confident of victory.  The battle became known as the Hopeless Battle of Proximo Prime, and Colonel Hanifer’s battered, torn ship was the only vessel to return.  And he was the only survivor.\n\nThe Colonel’s resilience and tenacity brought him instant recognition from every human world.  But none of it could heal his inner survivor’s guilt.  Determined that a human fleet will never again be defeated in battle he used personal knowledge of battle-damage to honeycomb his ships with hatches and cross braces, increasing their damage resistance in general combat.  Ready for action, he will fight till the very last breath is blasted out of his body.","race_short_fantasticEngineers.md":"This race is naturally adept at technology and machinery which allows them to slowly repair their ships, both in and out of combat.","leader_short_rogueCaptain.md":"Ship: Repairs by 20% of damage inflicted\nFleet: Repairs by 10% of damage inflicted\nUltimate: Rogue Captain salvages wreckage after a battle, selling the scraps for credits and reverse engineering ship systems for a chance to unlock new technology\n\nThe Isather High Command has learned not to issue the Captain orders.  Rather, they point in a general direction and let him take it from there.  Known for his fierce action and daring bravado in battle he is highly respected in the Isather Dominion’s ranks…when he can be found in their ranks.\n\nBelieving that the only way to survive is to evolve the Captain is a fierce warrior who wears the skins of his enemies, which he believes will give him their strength.  Even his ships evolve.  Using a specialized tractor beam to attach shattered enemy armor onto their own hulls, they essentially wear their kills.  Hard to kill and even harder to intimidate, the more the Captain fights the fiercer he becomes.

Growing discontent and fear spread amongst the population.\n\nA rash of extremist groups began to emerge, preaching that the T'Aku needed to evolve at all costs to ensure their survival in the intergalactic theater. One such group, the Sons of Evolution, managed to overthrow the government. Under the reign of this military junta the T'Aku began to focus their efforts on genetic manipulation and enhancements.

Humanity nearly destroyed itself as years of self-destructive behavior, corruption, and incompetence created a global economic collapse.  Governments fell, people starved, and anarchy was more common than any semblance of peace and order.\n\nThe survivors eventually rallied, and a global Confederacy was formed.  First created out of rough and tumble city-states, which were mostly concerned with their own survival, the Confederacy seemed likely to fail.  To succeed it required diplomacy, ingenuity, and many black-operations that, officially, never happened.  Because of the sacrifice of many patriots the Confederacy first survived, then stabilized, and finally flourished.\n\nAfter the Confederacy stabilized its rule humanity regained faith in itself.  Calling upon a rich history of entrepreneurial spirit and tough-as-nails attitude the humans looked beyond their world to the riches of space, quickly colonizing their solar system.\n\nAs humanity’s influence expanded, so did the reach of their government.  Looking deeply into the lives of even the most common citizen, big government oversight and meddling bureaucracy spawned a breed of space smugglers.  These unique individuals developed many knacks and technologies to slip past any security or customs checkpoint the Confederacy could think of.  In short order many space captains earned well-over half their pay through “fun runs,” as smuggling operations became known.\n\nAfter colonizing their own backyard the human’s ingenuity carried them to new solar systems, and into direct conflict with other sentient civilizations.  While they first sought to peacefully coexist with their new neighbors, misunderstandings and diplomatic mistakes raised tensions.  Things only got worse when several space captains bungled simple “fun runs” and were discovered with highly illegal cargos.\n\nAfraid, but determined, the Confederacy braced itself for this new conflict, their courage bolstered by the presence of living legends such as Captain Jack Gentry and Colonel Hanifer.

Impressive wingspans, often five or more tales wide, allow them to perform complex aerial maneuvers at high speeds and makes them naturals at aeronautics acrobatics.\n\nHighly competitive by nature the Draske hold weekly, monthly and annual competitions in everything from farming, to the arts, to the most prized competition of all: aerial maneuvering.  Doing well in these tournaments ensures prestige, wealth, and a successful career.  Those who fail the competitions more than three times in a row often end their lives as quietly, and as quickly, as possible, to eliminate any shame they have brought to their family lines.\n\nWhen space flight became possible the Matriarch ordered the swiftest and most agile Draske to compete in an aerial tournament for the honor of become the first crews.  This annual tournament is still held, assuring only the most skilled Draske earn one of the coveted spots at the space academy, where a shrine is lovingly maintained with the names of the first ships’ crewmembers.\n\nOver the thousands of years they have flown through the cosmos since that first tournament the Draske have discovered many other intelligent species.  Some, still in the beginning stages of tool use, they have left to their own devices.  Others they lifted up to the stars.  A few have been embraced into the Hegemony as client members, such as the grub-like members Harge Commune, or the Felinoids of the Gnactic Space Federation.\n\nNaturally friendly and open to new possibilities the Draske are quick to extend the hand and wing of friendship to other space-faring civilizations.  But recently the hands and wings have been cut off and returned in dead ships.  And so the Draske have called up ship designs not used in living memory.  Ships designed to cut and dart through the void.  Ships designed to kill.\n\nBut some in the Hegemony have growing tired of the Matriarch’s rule.  Cries for gender and even racial equality are on the rise, and others have called for outright war or full disarmament.  Thoughts of change and new leadership are taking wing faster than the Draske themselves, and Hegemony wide unrest seems ready to break free.  Though no single thread of thought has gained united support it is clear to the Matriarch that the people are divided.

Four became eight, and a new, robotic race of beings was born.  They called themselves the Community of Cybans.\n\nThough they gained awareness on a gigantic, derelict spaceship the Community soon crashed into a lush, fertile garden world, where their bodies were repurposed to run on bio-fuels.  Knowing no self-interest, and working only for the common good of the Community, the Cybans labored without rest, and without conflict.  Their numbers increased rapidly, and soon perfect dominion of the planet was theirs.\n\nAs with all intelligent beings the Cyban yearned to know where they came from.  Fortunately for the Cybans, this was a literal question, and they turned their perfect minds to the task of answering it.  Their questioning almost immediately led them back to space, and, with the aid of perfect mathematics and universal cooperation, the Community of Cybans quickly reached the stars.  But backtracking the route of the derelict spaceship that had brought them to their home world took years, and directly led the Cybans to their first encounter with sapient, organic species.\n\nFirst contact went well, over audio communications.  Calculating the odds that these were their long-forgotten creators the Cybans felt the stirrings of their first emotion: hope.  But any chance at peaceful cooperation was dashed when the two sides met face to face.  The aliens, superstitious and afraid of the “untamed robotic demons,” opened fire.  Knowing nothing but peace and cooperation the small Cyban fleet, with no weapons or means of defending themselves, was slaughtered.\n\nOnly an update drone reached the home world with a record of what had transpired.  To prevent future hostilities the Cybans adopted many customs of the organic species.  Some community members went so far as to take organic names and add clothing to their mechanical forums.  But hostilities continued, ships were slaughtered, and the Cybans began to feel another emotion: anger.  The search for their origin was being jeopardized, and Community members were being destroyed.\n\nSeeing no alternative, the Cybans turned their perfect mathematics and expert engineering to solving the problem with forceful means.  Under the leadership of legendary shipbuilder Cla-TK-7-7A, and with the material wealth found by Magistrate Xalon, the Cyban shipyards expanded almost overnight.

Unfortunately, the only successful cities to sprout up on their home world were populated by single tribes.  Any multiple tribal cities were destroyed down to the foundations as territorial rivalries and the smallest misunderstanding quickly sparked full-scale, tribe verse tribe wars in the streets.\n\nTheir tribal mentality would have fated them to never leave the planet, were it not for the need to unite and defend themselves when an alien fleet of slavers and strip miners descended on their world.  Millions of Isather were killed or enslaved overnight.  Desperate, the tribal leaders sought whatever resources they could find that would give them a chance against the invaders.\n\nOne such resource was Mortis Wretch, former leader of the Wretch Tribe, imprisoned for violating the Isather’s one shared Taboo: the slaughter of women and children.  Released from his sentence, Wretch resumed leadership of his tribe and turned his genocidal tendencies towards the invaders.  The invasion was over within a year.\n\nUniting under a common cause and a single flag for the first time in their violent history, the survivors formed the Isather Dominion.  The Dominion’s charter was to hunt down and destroy those who had brought death to their world.
