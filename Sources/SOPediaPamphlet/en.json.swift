Evolving from small, winged lizards and blessed with millennia-long lives the Draske are the undisputed masters of their planet.  Impressive wingspans, often five or more tales wide, allow them to perform complex aerial maneuvers at high speeds and makes them naturals at aeronautics acrobatics.\n\nHighly competitive by nature the Draske hold weekly, monthly and annual competitions in everything from farming, to the arts, to the most prized competition of all: aerial maneuvering.  Doing well in these tournaments ensures prestige, wealth, and a successful career.  Those who fail the competitions more than three times in a row often end their lives as quietly, and as quickly, as possible, to eliminate any shame they have brought to their family lines.\n\nWhen space flight became possible the Matriarch ordered the swiftest and most agile Draske to compete in an aerial tournament for the honor of become the first crews.  This annual tournament is still held, assuring only the most skilled Draske earn one of the coveted spots at the space academy, where a shrine is lovingly maintained with the names of the first ships’ crewmembers.\n\nOver the thousands of years they have flown through the cosmos since that first tournament the Draske have discovered many other intelligent species.  Some, still in the beginning stages of tool use, they have left to their own devices.  Others they lifted up to the stars.  A few have been embraced into the Hegemony as client members, such as the grub-like members Harge Commune, or the Felinoids of the Gnactic Space Federation.\n\nNaturally friendly and open to new possibilities the Draske are quick to extend the hand and wing of friendship to other space-faring civilizations.  But recently the hands and wings have been cut off and returned in dead ships.  And so the Draske have called up ship designs not used in living memory.  Ships designed to cut and dart through the void.  Ships designed to kill.\n\nBut some in the Hegemony have growing tired of the Matriarch’s rule.  Cries for gender and even racial equality are on the rise, and others have called for outright war or full disarmament.  Thoughts of change and new leadership are taking wing faster than the Draske themselves, and Hegemony wide unrest seems ready to break free.  Though no single thread of thought has gained united support it is clear to the Matriarch that the people are divided.  The coming times will see the continuation of the Hegemony, united in one flock as never before, or the sundering of the Draske into individual fliers, lacking direction and lost in a storm.","tech_advancedCityPlanning1.md":"Advances in city planning provides additional space for more population.

Perhaps they were the creation of a mad scientist, or maybe the end product of massive supercomputer.  However it happened the Cybans know that first there was one.  That one grew and developed in intelligence.  Discovering robotics left behind by its creators it developed a form, created a body.  One became two. Two became four.  Four became eight, and a new, robotic race of beings was born.  They called themselves the Community of Cybans.\n\nThough they gained awareness on a gigantic, derelict spaceship the Community soon crashed into a lush, fertile garden world, where their bodies were repurposed to run on bio-fuels.  Knowing no self-interest, and working only for the common good of the Community, the Cybans labored without rest, and without conflict.  Their numbers increased rapidly, and soon perfect dominion of the planet was theirs.\n\nAs with all intelligent beings the Cyban yearned to know where they came from.  Fortunately for the Cybans, this was a literal question, and they turned their perfect minds to the task of answering it.  Their questioning almost immediately led them back to space, and, with the aid of perfect mathematics and universal cooperation, the Community of Cybans quickly reached the stars.  But backtracking the route of the derelict spaceship that had brought them to their home world took years, and directly led the Cybans to their first encounter with sapient, organic species.\n\nFirst contact went well, over audio communications.  Calculating the odds that these were their long-forgotten creators the Cybans felt the stirrings of their first emotion: hope.  But any chance at peaceful cooperation was dashed when the two sides met face to face.  The aliens, superstitious and afraid of the “untamed robotic demons,” opened fire.  Knowing nothing but peace and cooperation the small Cyban fleet, with no weapons or means of defending themselves, was slaughtered.\n\nOnly an update drone reached the home world with a record of what had transpired.  To prevent future hostilities the Cybans adopted many customs of the organic species.  Some community members went so far as to take organic names and add clothing to their mechanical forums.  But hostilities continued, ships were slaughtered, and the Cybans began to feel another emotion: anger.  The search for their origin was being jeopardized, and Community members were being destroyed.\n\nSeeing no alternative, the Cybans turned their perfect mathematics and expert engineering to solving the problem with forceful means.  Under the leadership of legendary shipbuilder Cla-TK-7-7A, and with the material wealth found by Magistrate Xalon, the Cyban shipyards expanded almost overnight.  Instead of unarmed exploration ships they created destroyers and battleships with powerful weapons.  They still wanted to know where they came from, and if violence was required to find it than no organic would be left standing in their way.","tech_shieldModulationUnit.md":"By modulating the energies used to power shields, scientists discovered a method to allow shields to work inside of nebulae.

During the first eons of their existence they could have been mistaken as a small clouds drifting around their prehistoric world.  Over time the clouds grew and multiplied.  It wasn’t until their numbers swelled significantly that they formed the first intelligent thought.\n\nThe more the Vass grew and multiplied the more intelligent they became.  Eventually, they formed a communal consciousness, a shared intelligence.  After countless more millennia this developed into one of the most refined intellects in the known universe.\n\nThis intellect eventually pointed them to the stars.  Unaware of the limitations of their shared intelligence the Vass sent ships to explore the cosmos.  These explorations proved to be disastrous.  Once the venturing Vass traveled past the range of their shared intellect they rapidly grew confused and simpleminded, unable to perform any function that required higher-level intelligence.  Essentially crewless husks, these first ships still drift across the endless cosmos.\n\nUsing their shared intellect the Vass developed new ships, built from a crystalline element found on their home world.  These new designs, coupled with the natural properties of the crystal, allowed even the smallest vessel to carry enough Vass to maintain their intelligence.  When their foraying ships discovered alien life the horde became known as the to the universe as Vass Collective.\n\nInitially having no discernable leadership, the Collective concluded it needed a single being to lead them and interact with its neighbors.  It was the single-greatest problem the Collective had ever contemplated, and the solution came only after great struggle.  The answer redefined the way their race would forever look at themselves.\n\nOver a million of the eldest members of the Collective permanently linked their minds and melded their bodies into one, sacrificing their own lives for the greater good of the Vass.  The result was Eesathu, a member of the Collective and yet a Collective all by itself.  Able to function at the highest levels of intelligence while completely isolated, Eesathu became the leader the Vass needed.  He is their spokesperson, guide, and guardian.   And, to some Vass, a savior, pointing the way they must travel for further enlightenment.\n\nUnited as never before under its leadership, the Vass Collective has set out to expand and explore the galaxy.  Willing to live in peaceful harmony the Vass will accept new members into their fellowship, knowing they will become greater for the added thoughts.  But they will not let any race stop the expansion of the Collective.  And with their unified mind and unprecedented leader it will take a collective effort to stop them.","race_isather.md":"Of all the sentient civilizations in the galaxy none are more unpredictable, violent, or naturally deadly than the Isather Dominion.  For thousands of years the species was divided into numerous tribes that were at constant war with each other. First evolving from pack hunters they are naturally extremely territorial and prone to solving all problems with maximum, brute force and terrifyingly violent finality.\n\nAfter their Industrial Revolution many individuals found they had a natural affinity for metallurgy, and astounding buildings, monuments and even cities sprung up almost overnight.  Unfortunately, the only successful cities to sprout up on their home world were populated by single tribes.  Any multiple tribal cities were destroyed down to the foundations as territorial rivalries and the smallest misunderstanding quickly sparked full-scale, tribe verse tribe wars in the streets.\n\nTheir tribal mentality would have fated them to never leave the planet, were it not for the need to unite and defend themselves when an alien fleet of slavers and strip miners descended on their world.  Millions of Isather were killed or enslaved overnight.  Desperate, the tribal leaders sought whatever resources they could find that would give them a chance against the invaders.\n\nOne such resource was Mortis Wretch, former leader of the Wretch Tribe, imprisoned for violating the Isather’s one shared Taboo: the slaughter of women and children.  Released from his sentence, Wretch resumed leadership of his tribe and turned his genocidal tendencies towards the invaders.  The invasion was over within a year.\n\nUniting under a common cause and a single flag for the first time in their violent history, the survivors formed the Isather Dominion.  The Dominion’s charter was to hunt down and destroy those who had brought death to their world.  Using their natural high strength and almost innate skills in metallurgy the Isather labored to create their own starships.\n\nAfter many years and many more failures their labors were finally successful.  As the first exploration fleet lifted off from the planet a sense of accomplishment washed over the population.  They had risen from the ashes.  They had reached the stars.  And soon they would have vengeance for the mass graves that covered their planet.","tech_roboticsFacility1.md":"Automated factories driven by advanced robotics, increasing industrial production by 10.","tech_roboticsFacility2.md":"Automated factories driven by advanced robotics, increasing industrial production by 20.","tech_sanctionedSports.md":"The introduction of government sponsored sports will lift population morale by 20%.","unexplored_star11.md":"Class G stars are yellow in color.

Humanity nearly destroyed itself as years of self-destructive behavior, corruption, and incompetence created a global economic collapse.  Governments fell, people starved, and anarchy was more common than any semblance of peace and order.\n\nThe survivors eventually rallied, and a global Confederacy was formed.  First created out of rough and tumble city-states, which were mostly concerned with their own survival, the Confederacy seemed likely to fail.  To succeed it required diplomacy, ingenuity, and many black-operations that, officially, never happened.  Because of the sacrifice of many patriots the Confederacy first survived, then stabilized, and finally flourished.\n\nAfter the Confederacy stabilized its rule humanity regained faith in itself.  Calling upon a rich history of entrepreneurial spirit and tough-as-nails attitude the humans looked beyond their world to the riches of space, quickly colonizing their solar system.\n\nAs humanity’s influence expanded, so did the reach of their government.  Looking deeply into the lives of even the most common citizen, big government oversight and meddling bureaucracy spawned a breed of space smugglers.  These unique individuals developed many knacks and technologies to slip past any security or customs checkpoint the Confederacy could think of.  In short order many space captains earned well-over half their pay through “fun runs,” as smuggling operations became known.\n\nAfter colonizing their own backyard the human’s ingenuity carried them to new solar systems, and into direct conflict with other sentient civilizations.  While they first sought to peacefully coexist with their new neighbors, misunderstandings and diplomatic mistakes raised tensions.  Things only got worse when several space captains bungled simple “fun runs” and were discovered with highly illegal cargos.\n\nAfraid, but determined, the Confederacy braced itself for this new conflict, their courage bolstered by the presence of living legends such as Captain Jack Gentry and Colonel Hanifer.  Building new ships, training covert operatives, and capitalizing on its pilots smuggling skills, the Humans have prepared themselves to face any incoming threat with steely resolve, accurate fire, and silent knives in back rooms.
