He was disinherited by his wealthy family, and was never mentioned again in their house.  First serving on small ships during anti-smuggling operations Gentry was soon recognized as a keen tactician and excellent battle-manager.  He progressed rapidly up the ranks, and was chosen to command the Coalition’s first Mammoth class ship.  But when offered a spot at the Navy’s Tactical and Strategic War College he refused; his crew had become his new family, and he wouldn’t leave them.\n\nDespite staying a captain, Gentry’s forceful personality and influence is no small thing.  He has seen action in almost every battle of the confederation, and he and his ship have become living legends in the Coalition, used to sign up and inspire countless new recruits.  His skills, highly experienced crew, and ship modifications make him a deadly threat to anyone unlucky enough to be his enemy.","race_short_smallHomeworld.md":"Race begins the game with a small homeworld instead of a large homeworld.","tech_short_heavyArmorPlating2.md":"By lacing the armor with xentronium, the armor's effectiveness will be increased by 25% + 10 points.

During the first eons of their existence they could have been mistaken as a small clouds drifting around their prehistoric world.  Over time the clouds grew and multiplied.  It wasn’t until their numbers swelled significantly that they formed the first intelligent thought.\n\nThe more the Vass grew and multiplied the more intelligent they became.  Eventually, they formed a communal consciousness, a shared intelligence.  After countless more millennia this developed into one of the most refined intellects in the known universe.\n\nThis intellect eventually pointed them to the stars.  Unaware of the limitations of their shared intelligence the Vass sent ships to explore the cosmos.  These explorations proved to be disastrous.  Once the venturing Vass traveled past the range of their shared intellect they rapidly grew confused and simpleminded, unable to perform any function that required higher-level intelligence.  Essentially crewless husks, these first ships still drift across the endless cosmos.\n\nUsing their shared intellect the Vass developed new ships, built from a crystalline element found on their home world.  These new designs, coupled with the natural properties of the crystal, allowed even the smallest vessel to carry enough Vass to maintain their intelligence.  When their foraying ships discovered alien life the horde became known as the to the universe as Vass Collective.\n\nInitially having no discernable leadership, the Collective concluded it needed a single being to lead them and interact with its neighbors.  It was the single-greatest problem the Collective had ever contemplated, and the solution came only after great struggle.  The answer redefined the way their race would forever look at themselves.\n\nOver a million of the eldest members of the Collective permanently linked their minds and melded their bodies into one, sacrificing their own lives for the greater good of the Vass.  The result was Eesathu, a member of the Collective and yet a Collective all by itself.  Able to function at the highest levels of intelligence while completely isolated, Eesathu became the leader the Vass needed.  He is their spokesperson, guide, and guardian.   And, to some Vass, a savior, pointing the way they must travel for further enlightenment.\n\nUnited as never before under its leadership, the Vass Collective has set out to expand and explore the galaxy.  Willing to live in peaceful harmony the Vass will accept new members into their fellowship, knowing they will become greater for the added thoughts.  But they will not let any race stop the expansion of the Collective.  And with their unified mind and unprecedented leader it will take a collective effort to stop them.","UNEXPLORED_STAR6.md":"Class M stars glare red and dim in the night sky.

While she would prefer to live untouched by the universe around her, at peace in her underground kingdom, she knows to do so would only invite extinction.  To ensure her children spread across the galaxy she is willing to lend her knowledge to those who know how to ask for it.\n\nAn expert in reproduction, even in other species, she knows what it takes to successfully raise young ones.

Tyrrhenius was the most famous and successful smuggler and pilot the Confederation ever had the privilege, and displeasure, of encountering.  Massive ship augmentations gave his renegade fleet increased range and unlimited cloaking, letting him make “fun runs” past blockading fleets undetected.  His physical augmentations are no less impressive.  By replacing large parts of his body with cybernetic implants Tyrrhenius is able to interface directly with his ship as never before, greatly increasing its handling in combat.\n\nWhen Tyrrhenius was finally tracked down and cornered by Captain Jack Gentry he was given three choices; he could be annihilated, spend the rest of his life in prison, or he could work for the Confederation.  Today, Tyrrhenius is one of humanity’s most ruthless commanders, threatening the rear of an enemy fleet with attacks they never imagine are coming.  But he is, first and foremost, out for himself, and will always sign up for a tour of “fun runs” with any empire willing to pay his fee.

Though his comrades derided him as a coward he held true to his beliefs, even as his words came back to haunt him.  When his fellow admirals, eager for blood on their claws, charged into the largest fleet battle the Federation had ever fought Kzzt held true to his beliefs and kept his command at extreme range.  Pouring thousands of missiles into the enemy, while dodging hundreds of return salvos, Kzzt’s and his command were the battle’s only survivors.\n\nAs the highest-ranking military officer left in the Federation, Kzzt allied his people with the Draske Hegemony.  Continuing to study missiles and extended-envelop warfare Kzzt has perfected his long-distance strategy.  Now, using only racial Draske as his pilots, coupled with his intense understanding of long-range engagements, makes him a deadly threat that cannot be ignored on the battlefield.","tech_short_plasmaTurret3.md":"Advances in targeting technology can compute new trajectories for the plasma, allowing it more time to expand further in the same distance travelled.","UNEXPLORED_STAR10.md":"Class F stars the most numerous of the blue-white stars.

Others, like Colonel Hanifer, are forged in a single moment.  When the Coalition Navy first fought its first extra solar battle it felt confident of victory.  The battle became known as the Hopeless Battle of Proximo Prime, and Colonel Hanifer’s battered, torn ship was the only vessel to return.  And he was the only survivor.\n\nThe Colonel’s resilience and tenacity brought him instant recognition from every human world.  But none of it could heal his inner survivor’s guilt.  Determined that a human fleet will never again be defeated in battle he used personal knowledge of battle-damage to honeycomb his ships with hatches and cross braces, increasing their damage resistance in general combat.

Rather, they point in a general direction and let him take it from there.  Known for his fierce action and daring bravado in battle he is highly respected in the Isather Dominion’s ranks…when he can be found in their ranks.\n\nBelieving that the only way to survive is to evolve the Captain is a fierce warrior who wears the skins of his enemies, which he believes will give him their strength.  Even his ships evolve.  Using a specialized tractor beam to attach shattered enemy armor onto their own hulls, they essentially wear their kills.  Hard to kill and even harder to intimidate, the more the Captain fights the fiercer he becomes.

One such group, the Sons of Evolution, managed to overthrow the government. Under the reign of this military junta the T'Aku began to focus their efforts on genetic manipulation and enhancements.

Humanity nearly destroyed itself as years of self-destructive behavior, corruption, and incompetence created a global economic collapse.  Governments fell, people starved, and anarchy was more common than any semblance of peace and order.\n\nThe survivors eventually rallied, and a global Coalition was formed.  First created out of rough and tumble city-states, which were mostly concerned with their own survival, the Coalition seemed likely to fail.  To succeed it required diplomacy, ingenuity, and many black-operations that, officially, never happened.  Because of the sacrifice of many patriots the Coalition first survived, then stabilized, and finally flourished.\n\nAfter the Coalition stabilized its rule humanity regained faith in itself.  Calling upon a rich history of entrepreneurial spirit and tough-as-nails attitude the humans looked beyond their world to the riches of space, quickly colonizing their solar system.\n\nAs humanity’s influence expanded, so did the reach of their government.  Looking deeply into the lives of even the most common citizen, big government oversight and meddling bureaucracy spawned a breed of space smugglers.  These unique individuals developed many knacks and technologies to slip past any security or customs checkpoint the Coalition could think of.  In short order many space captains earned well-over half their pay through “fun runs,” as smuggling operations became known.\n\nAfter colonizing their own backyard the human’s ingenuity carried them to new solar systems, and into direct conflict with other sentient civilizations.  While they first sought to peacefully coexist with their new neighbors, misunderstandings and diplomatic mistakes raised tensions.  Things only got worse when several space captains bungled simple “fun runs” and were discovered with highly illegal cargos.\n\nAfraid, but determined, the Coalition braced itself for this new conflict, their courage bolstered by the presence of living legends such as Captain Jack Gentry and Colonel Hanifer.

The survivors would eventually find their way to nearby communities as experienced wanders, where they are taught to be productive members of society.\n\nNatural chemists, the **Uggathaaa** society developed and advanced in unprecedented ways, all without the discovery of fire. Despite this enlightenment the **Uggathaaa** spent millennium stagnating on the bottom of their oceans, cycling through century-long periods of growth and decay until fate stepped in by way of a breathing mutation. This mutation stepped out on dry land, looked up at the stars, and questioned their existence.\n\nWith the questioned asked, the massive industry and scientific infrastructure of thousands of years quickly took them to the Void. With their quick breeding the Commune quickly spread among the stars, quickly making enemies with their aggressive expansion. Whether their swarm tactics can adapt to the void and dominate the ocean of the stars like those of the home world is anyone's guess.","race_short_money1.md":"-1\/2 Credit Per Population  \nMembers of

Impressive wingspans, often five or more tales wide, allow them to perform complex aerial maneuvers at high speeds and makes them naturals at aeronautics acrobatics.\n\nHighly competitive by nature the Draske hold weekly, monthly and annual competitions in everything from farming, to the arts, to the most prized competition of all: aerial maneuvering.  Doing well in these tournaments ensures prestige, wealth, and a successful career.  Those who fail the competitions more than three times in a row often end their lives as quietly, and as quickly, as possible, to eliminate any shame they have brought to their family lines.\n\nWhen space flight became possible the Matriarch ordered the swiftest and most agile Draske to compete in an aerial tournament for the honor of become the first crews.  This annual tournament is still held, assuring only the most skilled Draske earn one of the coveted spots at the space academy, where a shrine is lovingly maintained with the names of the first ships’ crewmembers.\n\nOver the thousands of years they have flown through the cosmos since that first tournament the Draske have discovered many other intelligent species.

But recently the hands and wings have been cut off and returned in dead ships.  And so the Draske have called up ship designs not used in living memory.  Ships designed to cut and dart through the void.  Ships designed to kill.\n\nBut some in the Hegemony have growing tired of the Matriarch’s rule.  Cries for gender and even racial equality are on the rise, and others have called for outright war or full disarmament.  Thoughts of change and new leadership are taking wing faster than the Draske themselves, and Hegemony wide unrest seems ready to break free.  Though no single thread of thought has gained united support it is clear to the Matriarch that the people are divided.

That one grew and developed in intelligence.  Discovering robotics left behind by its creators it developed a form, created a body.  One became two. Two became four.  Four became eight, and a new, robotic race of beings was born.  They called themselves the Community of Cybans.\n\nThough they gained awareness on a gigantic, derelict spaceship the Community soon crashed into a lush, fertile garden world, where their bodies were repurposed to run on bio-fuels.  Knowing no self-interest, and working only for the common good of the Community, the Cybans labored without rest, and without conflict.  Their numbers increased rapidly, and soon perfect dominion of the planet was theirs.\n\nAs with all intelligent beings the Cyban yearned to know where they came from.  Fortunately for the Cybans, this was a literal question, and they turned their perfect minds to the task of answering it.  Their questioning almost immediately led them back to space, and, with the aid of perfect mathematics and universal cooperation, the Community of Cybans quickly reached the stars.  But backtracking the route of the derelict spaceship that had brought them to their home world took years, and directly led the Cybans to their first encounter with sapient, organic species.\n\nFirst contact went well, over audio communications.  Calculating the odds that these were their long-forgotten creators the Cybans felt the stirrings of their first emotion: hope.  But any chance at peaceful cooperation was dashed when the two sides met face to face.  The aliens, superstitious and afraid of the “untamed robotic demons,” opened fire.  Knowing nothing but peace and cooperation the small Cyban fleet, with no weapons or means of defending themselves, was slaughtered.\n\nOnly an update drone reached the home world with a record of what had transpired.  To prevent future hostilities the Cybans adopted many customs of the organic species.  Some community members went so far as to take organic names and add clothing to their mechanical forums.  But hostilities continued, ships were slaughtered, and the Cybans began to feel another emotion: anger.  The search for their origin was being jeopardized, and Community members were being destroyed.\n\nSeeing no alternative, the Cybans turned their perfect mathematics and expert engineering to solving the problem with forceful means.  Under the leadership of legendary shipbuilder Cla-TK-7-7A, and with the material wealth found by Magistrate Xalon, the Cyban shipyards expanded almost overnight.  Instead of unarmed exploration ships they created destroyers and battleships with powerful weapons.

Therefore, I feel the need to go into some detail about what makes the trait so special in order to shed some light on the current situation.\n> \n> For a long time, Persnickety was a relatively obscure trait whose more intricate workings were not well understood by most players and which was not used much by veteran players. Prior to v1.2.1 which saw an overhaul of some of the most central mechanical features of Starbase Orion, such as civic funding, ship movement and certain key buildings like Research Center and Orbital Laboratory, Persnickety wasn't used by the top players of the time like VanderLegion and Diebo, who'd always preferred Shared Intelligence, or 37ddV and MarcusVictor, who had invented a nigh-unbeatable industry blitz strategy relying on rapid advancement towards the opponent and cruisers fitted with L3, still the most cost-effective and reliable weapon in the entire game. Both groups of veteran players counted on passive RP from Research Centers and Orbital Labs, buildings which then did not force you to assign colonists as scientists in order to be useful as they do now. In an environment like this, Persnickety was not really needed because the bonus it provided to research was wasted: you just didn't need scientists at the time if you played the right way. That was in 2012 which is when I myself started playing this game.\n> \n> Then, in v1.2.1, everything that changed. Research buildings no longer provided any passive RP. Research traits, on the other hand -- previously not much used -- received a huge boost. Civic funding was soft capped to prevent abuse by mechanics gurus like Diebo who had used it in conjunction with high industry output to grow population exponentially, which forced a shift in population growth strategies towards Cloning Center and Colony Ship II.\n> \n> It took a while for players to get their bearings in the new environment, and Skins0815, a relative newcomer back then, was the first player to realize and exploit the potential in Persnickety in post-v1.2.1 Starbase Orion. He found out that **the bonus to industry and research provided by Persnickety stacks both with other racial bonuses and with unit bonuses from buildings like Efficient Factories and Research Center**, which is not all that apparent because not many things in SO provide a percentage bonus to colonist productivity and the trait's description says nothing about its interaction with other bonuses. This is a big deal so I will explain in detail what this means in practice.\n> \n> Let's say you have a scientist happily researching away on some planet and Persnickety is the only racial trait you have. As the description says, you get a 20% bonus to all research, and since scientists normally produce 3 RP\/turn each, the bonus you get from Persnickety is 3 RP\/turn * 0.2 = 0.6 RP\/turn. Although you get the same 20% bonus to industry from Persnickety, if this were all there was to the trait, the penalties the trait gives to morale and farming would mean that it wouldn't be all that great.\n> \n> However, let's now pair Persnickety with Borderline Genius which essentially doubles your scientists' effectiveness by granting you +3 RP\/turn\/scientist for a total of 6 RP\/turn\/scientist. Now, because Persnickety stacks on top of the bonus from Borderline Genius, the bonus it provides doubles as well to 1.2 RP\/turn\/scientist. Got Research Center I too? Congratulations, Persnickety now gives you 6+1 RP\/turn\/scientist * 0.2 = 1.4 RP\/turn\/scientist. Got RC3? Congratulations, this one trait now gives a 1.8 RP\/turn bonus to the output of each of your scientists. Not too bad anymore for a 3 point trait, huh? (Used to be only 2 racial points before v1.2.2, by the way -- even Rocco was eventually convinced that Persnickety was a little too good for that price.) Naturally, you do have to consider the 5% morale penalty as well, but even so, you end up with +1.4 RP\/scientist\/turn if you have all the goodies. I'll address the farming penalty's significance in a moment.\n> \n> So that's *in addition* to the bonus you get to industry. Persnickety is actually even nicer with industry because the base productivity of a worker can be up to 7 PP\/turn on a very rich planet, more than double the base productivity of a scientist on any planet. The quickest readers will already have calculated that you can get up to +2.4 PP\/turn\/worker from Persnickety if you also have Amazing Industrialists and both EF2 and Planetary Core Mining on a very rich planet (7+2+2+1 * 0.2), minus the morale penalty for a net bonus of +1.8 PP\/turn\/worker.\n> \n> It's understandable that Persnickety is mutually exclusive with Shared Intelligence, otherwise we'd be seeing every decent player use both traits in every game.\n> \n> Two things can be deduced at this point. First of all, you need both Amazing Industrialists and Borderline Genius in order to take full advantage of Persnickety, and that requires a lot of racial points: 6+6+3=15, already over the base allotment by 5 points without considering any other traits you might want to take. Secondly, since you can't take Shared Intelligence to ease farming on your HW in addition to its other benefits, you need some way of doing farming efficiently or the bonuses Persnickety gives won't be all that useful with much of your talented population being re-educated in the delights of manual labor out on the fields.\n> \n> This used to be less of a problem back when everybody started with a free 20% bonus to farming gained from the binary star of their home system. Not necessarily having that boost to farming anymore is a big deal to any player with Persnickety, who grudgingly had to assign a lot of farmers at the beginning of the game even when you did start with a certain binary home star. If that were the only change bad for Persnickety, we might still be seeing some top players use the trait in 1v1, but the biggest problem for Persnickety builds now is the nerf that Cloning Center got back in v1.2.3.\n> \n> No longer the early game tech that easily let you overcome the pop growth penalty from Old Fashioned that it once was, Cloning Center is now too far back in the civil research tree to solve early game population growth for builds with Old Fashioned. There are not too many point-giving negative traits in the game whose penalty is acceptable for the points you get, so getting all the points you need for a full-blown Persnickety build is tough, which is why Old Fashioned was always taken back when CC was easy to get. Now, you have precisely two options if you don't want your population growth to stagnate and be overrun by a more fecund adversary: either pick Fertile Biology or Baby Boomers, or get a shitload of science starting from turn 1 and rely on IMN until you research cloning. The latter option is not possible for Persnickety builds because you need too many farmers in the beginning, bonus food from Hydroponic Centers notwithstanding, so picking either Fertile Biology or Baby Boomers seems to be the only way for Persnickety builds to still stand a chance in a competitive match against a good player using a SI science build. Having to pick Fertile Biology hurts because it means you can no longer afford to get Amazing Industrialists and Freethinking, and so your productivity suffers.\n> \n> The strength of Persnickety, when properly used, is that it allows for a racial build strong both in science and industry. Early game industry was more important when you had to build Cloning Centers ASAP on all your planets after researching the tech early on, but that is still a distinct advantage that Persnickety builds have over SI science builds relying on Robust Techies for their early game industry. You can use that industry either to attack quickly if the map is small enough or to hoard it for when you eventually get CS2, which will be later than your SI-using opponent but not necessarily too late on a big map. I have come up with one Persnickety build in v1.2.5 using Fertile Biology (only Industrious Individuals) that is capable of staggering growth by around stardate 406.1 on quick game speed if you beeline towards CS2 (no IMN) and hoard industry on your rich and very rich planets in anticipation. Science SI with Fertile Biology (no BR) is able to begin a CS2 expansion by around 10 turns earlier with IMN and ACP3, albeit with somewhat less hoarded industry initially, so my money is on SI over Persnickety at the moment but Persnickety is certainly not bad either. It may not allow for the kind of powerhouse builds it once did but **Persnickety is still a very useful and versatile trait.**\n>\n>Excerpt from the **STRATEGY GUIDE FOR STARBASE ORION V1.2.5**  \n>by anthee","UNEXPLORED_STAR20.md":"Class M stars glare red and dim in the night sky.

When slavers and strip miners invaded the home world he was released from prison to wreck havoc on their enemy.  He is respected by some and, though they are grateful for his actions, feared and reviled by many more.  But none will deny how effective, and needed, he is.\n\nPreaching xenophobia, he inspires fanatical devotion in new crops of pilots and marines, preparing them accept anything, even suicide, for glory.  Reveling in panic, pain, and fear he specializes in attacks against population centers, finding a twisted glory in genocidal destruction.  His actions incite fury and hatred from his enemies, placing him at the top of nearly every “kill at all cost” list in existence.  Mortis Wretch welcomes the battles his notoriety will bring.\n\t\t","race_short_isather.md":"Of all the sentient civilizations in the galaxy none are more unpredictable, violent, or naturally deadly than the Isather Dominion.  For thousands of years the species was divided into numerous tribes that were at constant war with each other. First evolving from pack hunters they are naturally extremely territorial and prone to solving all problems with maximum, brute force and terrifyingly violent finality.\n\nAfter their Industrial Revolution many individuals found they had a natural affinity for metallurgy, and astounding buildings, monuments and even cities sprung up almost overnight.  Unfortunately, the only successful cities to sprout up on their home world were populated by single tribes.  Any multiple tribal cities were destroyed down to the foundations as territorial rivalries and the smallest misunderstanding quickly sparked full-scale, tribe verse tribe wars in the streets.\n\nTheir tribal mentality would have fated them to never leave the planet, were it not for the need to unite and defend themselves when an alien fleet of slavers and strip miners descended on their world.  Millions of Isather were killed or enslaved overnight.  Desperate, the tribal leaders sought whatever resources they could find that would give them a chance against the invaders.\n\nOne such resource was Mortis Wretch, former leader of the Wretch Tribe, imprisoned for violating the Isather’s one shared Taboo: the slaughter of women and children.  Released from his sentence, Wretch resumed leadership of his tribe and turned his genocidal tendencies towards the invaders.  The invasion was over within a year.\n\nUniting under a common cause and a single flag for the first time in their violent history, the survivors formed the Isather Dominion.  The Dominion’s charter was to hunt down and destroy those who had brought death to their world.  Using their natural high strength and almost innate skills in metallurgy the Isather labored to create their own starships.\n\nAfter many years and many more failures their labors were finally successful.  As the first exploration fleet lifted off from the planet a sense of accomplishment washed over the population.  They had risen from the ashes.  They had reached the stars.  And soon they would have vengeance for the mass graves that covered their planet.","tech_short_tradePort2.md":"An upgrade trade port increases colony income by 75%.","tech_short_researchCenter1.md":"A laboratory that increases research production +1 for each scientist.","UNEXPLORED_STAR12.md":"Class K stars have the best chance of containing habitable planets, but those planets are often poor in mineral resources.

A Collective within a Collective, Eesathu serves as the Vass’s all-powerful social and military leader, and, to some, a religious-like messiah as well.  Under its leadership the Vass Collective has become one of the most influential, and deadly, forces in the galaxy.\n\nAble to carry on vast conversations with its inner collective in seconds, Eesathu’s mind is capable of astounding leaps of logic and startling innovations of technology.  These advances have given the Vass fleets the needed edge in many battles, and will prove telling in the conflicts to come.  But Eesathu knows there is more knowledge to be gained in the galaxy, and is willing to sell his services to obtain it.

Growing up with debilitating health defects and barely able to walk when most children started to fly, it was feared they would never lead a normal life.\n\nDeveloping intense psychic abilities in their late adolescence the twins learned how to read other beings’ minds.  As they grew so did the range of their abilities, allowing them to sense sapient beings in other solar systems.  Recognizing their potential they were installed as governors of the home world, where their abilities allow them to perfectly tend to the population’s needs.  It also gives the military quick access to the twins, allowing them to track fleet movements throughout the galaxy.","leader_short_paramecium.md":"**Planet:** +2 food per farmer\n**System:** Biorich Fungi (+4 food per planet)\n**Ultimate:** +1 food per farmer; Paramecium's special food halves the cost of freighting food and doubles the revenue received from excess food sales\n\nProving that evolution has no limits to its strangeness Director Paramecium and the Harge closely resemble terrestrial slugs.  When the Draske first discovered the Harge home world they thought the rolling fields of grain were somehow a natural phenomenon.  After a surprising first contact the Draske incorporated the Harge Commune into the Hegemony, and both have benefited from the union.\n\nDirector Paramecium is an adept farmer, instinctively knowing what each plant needs to reach its maximum potential.  Its body also excretes a powerful chemical that naturally encourages plant growth.  Using both these methods it increases not only the yield, but also the quality of the harvest, and restaurants throughout the galaxy eagerly pay huge premiums to get the bounty on their tables.  But, despite being a client member of the Hegemony, all Director Paramecium wants to do is grow green things, and it will do so for any civilization willing to offer it free reign.","tech_short_roboticsFacility1.md":"Automated factories driven by advanced robotics, increasing industrial production by 10.","tech_short_additionalFuelReserves.md":"Fills a large portion of the ship's storage space with additional fuel cells, allowing it to travel 2 parsecs farther than normal.
