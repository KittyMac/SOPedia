Though they landed on a fertile planet, the Cyban home world did not have easily accessed material wealth.  To correct this a small team of Cybans created Magistrate Xalon out of the very rock of their world.  Unfortunately for the Cybans the units and facility that created Xalon were destroyed in the process, leaving it as the most unique Cyban in the Community.

Designed as a miner, Xalon was found to have unexpected abilities.  Due to its natural affinity with the elements it is able to sense precious metals and minerals, leading teams to exploit them.  These bonanzas of material wealth enable it to greatly increase the production of whatever planet it is on, making his enemies work twice as hard to keep up. But it is always hungry to find new mineral deposits, and is willing to work for any civilization that will let it explore their planets.
