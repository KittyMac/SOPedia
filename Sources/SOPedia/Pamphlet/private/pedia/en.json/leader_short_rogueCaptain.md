The Isather High Command has learned not to issue the Captain orders.  Rather, they point in a general direction and let him take it from there.  Known for his fierce action and daring bravado in battle he is highly respected in the Isather Dominion’s ranks…when he can be found in their ranks.

Believing that the only way to survive is to evolve the Captain is a fierce warrior who wears the skins of his enemies, which he believes will give him their strength.  Even his ships evolve.  Using a specialized tractor beam to attach shattered enemy armor onto their own hulls, they essentially wear their kills.  Hard to kill and even harder to intimidate, the more the Captain fights the fiercer he becomes.  The Captain is always looking for a new fight, and is willing to work for anyone, provided there is promise of enough coin, battle, and glory to be had.
