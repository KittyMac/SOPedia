####Morale

Empire morale is a measure of how happy your colonists are. If colonists are happy, then their production (food, industry, research) is increased. If colonists are disgruntled, then productivity is decreased.

You can touch any of the production lines in the planet view to see a summary of how that value is calculated. If you have bad morale, then you will see a negative morale penalty. If you have good morale, you will see a bonus.
