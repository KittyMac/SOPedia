####Research Proposals

There are three areas of research available; Astrophysics, Military, and Civil. Each area of research has several project proposals available for funding; you can choose one project per area you would like your empire to focus on developing.

####Limited Time To Fund

When you successfully research a project all other projects in that area which did not get funded are negatively impacted. The longer you choose not to fund a project, the more likely it is the project will be dropped in favor of a new project. This is represented by the status colored dots to the left of the proposal title.

One red dot means that the proposal will be dropped if you "pass" on it again. Two yellow dots means it will be dropped in two passes. Three green dots means that it will be dropped in three passes.

####Empire Attributes

There are several racial attributes that affect how your empire performs. For example, the Natrual Tinkers trait will help an industry focused race produce research without having population devoted to science. Brilliant Researchers will have a chance to learn bonus technologies when they successfully research a new technology. Small-minded Scientists and Broad-field Experimentalists will also change the rate at which you advance through the tech tree, making it possible to reach higher techs faster or to skip less technology overall.

> A pet peeve of mine in 4X games is an overabundance of incremental technology, wrapped up in a research system that doesn’t require tough (i.e. meaningful) choices. Thankfully, Starbase Orion avoids this issue. The technology system in Starbase Orion is simple mechanically but has deep implications.

> There are three research fields, and depending on your racial traits a player will have half a dozen or so technologies they can research in each field. When you research an item in a field, items you didn’t research move down the list, going from green, to yellow, to red in color each time. When they are “red”, they will next fall off the list completely and won’t be available again until you cycle all the way through that technology field. 
> 
> This system means that within each field you can’t research everything and you have to make tough choices. Do you choose a tech to upgrade your industrial efficiency or one that increases your maximum colony population? Do you choose to research trade ports to boost your income or Star Dirve technologies so your fleets move faster? What about weapon systems? Should you go with upgrading your lasers or do you hold out for Gauss Cannons? You have to consider your choices carefully because most of the technologies have significant ramifications for how your empire develops and the options that are open to you.
