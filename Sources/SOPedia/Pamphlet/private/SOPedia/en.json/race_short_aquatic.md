This race started out as an underwater lifeform but has since learned to survive on dry land too, whether through evolution or technology. Aquatic races start with an ocean homeworld and treat ocean planets as terran for the purposes of population capacity. Aquatic farmers produce 4 food per worker on ocean planets. Terraforming planets will work to make Aquatic planets ocean, while gaia planets can be developed from either terran or ocean.
