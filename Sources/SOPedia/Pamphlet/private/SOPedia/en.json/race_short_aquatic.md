This race started out as an underwater lifeform but has since learned to survive on dry land too, whether through evolution or technology. Aquatic races start with an ocean homeworld and benefit from a number of bonuses on water-based planets: increased maximum population on tundra, swamp and ocean (to swamp, arid and terran norms, respectively), increased food production on swamp (+1) and ocean (+2), and an additional building slot on ocean. However, arid and terran planets are correspondingly less suitable for aquatic races: population limits are reduced to desert and swamp norms, respectively, and farming on terran is reduced by â€“1. The race always starts with a tundra planet in their home system instead of desert. Finally, their terraforming sequence is changed to reflect their specific habitat preferences, and gaia transformation may be built only on ocean instead of terran.
