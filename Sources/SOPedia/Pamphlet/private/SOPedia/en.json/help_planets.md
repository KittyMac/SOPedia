###Classification

![](/shared/planets/toxic_planet.png)  
**TOXIC**  
Planets with a very noxious atmosphere. Farming is impossible. +50% maintenance cost on buildings due to the corrosive gases.

![](/shared/planets/radiated_planet.png)  
**RADIATED**  
Planet irradiated by a long gone disasters. Farming is impossible. +25% maintenance cost on buildings to block out the harmful radiation.

![](/shared/planets/barren_planet.png)  
**BARREN**  
Planetary bodies completely devoid of atmosphere. Farming is impossible.

![](/shared/planets/desert_planet.png)  
**DESERT**  
Dry planets in close orbit to the star. Buildings are subjected to constant scouring by sandy winds, increasing maintenance cost on buildings by +25%. Farming is difficult but not impossible, each farmer producing only 1 unit of food.

![](/shared/planets/tundra_planet.png)  
**TUNDRA**  
Desert planets in distant orbits to the star, leaving the surface a frozen wasteland. Farming is difficult but not impossible, each farmer producing only 1 unit of food.

![](/shared/planets/ocean_planet.png)  
**OCEAN**  
Watery planets where surface land is extremely rare. The water, however, is teaming with life and farming is possible. Each farmer produces 2 units of food.

![](/shared/planets/swamp_planet.png)
**SWAMP**  
Wet planets teeming with plant life. Fields can be excavated, allowing farmers to produce 2 units of food each.

![](/shared/planets/arid_planet.png)  
**ARID**  
Large, dry worlds similar to desert planets but without the biting winds. Farming is difficult but not impossible, each farmer producing only 1 unit of food.

![](/shared/planets/terran_planet.png)  
**TERRAN**  
A planet with a good mixture of land, water, and native plant life. Each farmer produces 3 units of food.

![](/shared/planets/gaia_planet.png)  
**GAIA**  
A planet which is perfect is almost every way. Soil is rich in nutrients and perfect for farming, each farmer produces 5 units of food.

###Minerals

**VERY MINERAL POOR**  
Planets that lack natural deposits of ore and other minerals. Each worker can produce 1 unit of industry.

**MINERAL POOR**  
Planets that have some deposits of poor quality ore. Enough that workers can produce 2 units of industry.

**MINERAL ABUNDANT**  
Planets with abundant natural ore deposits. Workers on this planet produce 3 units of industry.

**MINERAL RICH**  
Planets containing many deposits of high quality ore. Every worker produces 5 units of industry.

**MINERAL VERY RICH**  
Planets with very rich mineral deposits close to the surface. Workers on this planet produce 7 units of industry.

###Gravity

**LOW GRAVITY**  
This planet has a lower gravity than average. Races which are not accustomed to this suffer a -25% penalty to all productivity.

**NORMAL GRAVITY**  
This planet has average gravitational pull. Races which are not accustomed to this suffer a -25% penalty to all productivity.

**HIGH GRAVITY**  
This planet has an above average gravitational pull. Races which are not accustomed to this suffer a -50% penalty to all productivity.
