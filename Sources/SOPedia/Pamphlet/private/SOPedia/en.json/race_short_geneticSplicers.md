This race specializes in advanced genetic manipulation, allowing them to splice and alter the DNA of living organisms to achieve new desired traits. They have the capability to enhance physical abilities such as strength, agility, and lifespan, as well as manipulate mental abilities such as intelligence and emotional capacity. This ability is triggered by subjecting portions of their population to genetic experimenation, otherwise known as "splicing". The more population you splice, the more new racial attributes your empire can achieve. Splicing different species will widen the gene pool, allowing for even more forced evolution.
