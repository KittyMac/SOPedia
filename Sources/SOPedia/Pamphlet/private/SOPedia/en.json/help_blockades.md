####When does a blockade happen?

When fleets from multiple, non-allied empires are orbiting the same star system the colonies on that system may become blockaded.

Each fleet is assigned a **blockade strength**, which is the combined **combat value** of each ship in the fleet.

**Combat value** of a ship is calculated by:

```
(sum of the research cost of all equipped weapons) * (normalized health of the ship)
```

If you view the fleet info in game (select the fleet on the galactic map and press the "i" button in the fleet window) the blockade strength of the fleet will be displayed for you.

The combined **blockade strength** of all friendly fleets is compared against the combined **blockade strength** of all enemy fleets. If the strength of the enemy fleets is greater than the strength of the friendly fleets, then that empire's planets will be blockaded in that system.

Blockaded systems are denoted with a small red ring surrounding the star system on the galactic map. They will also appear visually different in the empire and planet views.

####Highly Trained Smugglers

Empires which have the [Highly Trained Smugglers](javascript:openPedia('highlyTrainedSmugglers')) trait are adapt by by-passing blockades. This is reflected in the **blockade strength** calculate by ignoring the **combat value** of the highest three ships in the enemy fleet.

Planets and systems which are under blockade have the following restrictions:

- You may not upgrade ships in the blockaded system
- You may not colonize new planets in the blockaded system
- You may not purchase production at blockaded planets
- You may not scrap ships at blockaded star systems
- You may not salvage ships at blockaded planets
- You may not use Warp Gates at blockaded systems
- You may not transport colonists in or out of a blockaded system
- Excess food at blockaded systems will not be shared with the rest of your empire
- You may not move leaders on blockaded planets
- You may not produces ships on blockaded planets
- Blockaded planets no longer produce credits from trade goods
