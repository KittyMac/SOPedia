**Planet:** Immune to starvation during a blockade. Marine capacity is doubled.
**System:** Immune to sabotage
**Ultimate:** Starbases in this system are converted into Fve Bgeeep's Burrow

Forced to watch the destruction of his race from a weaponless asteroid tug, Fve Bgeeep canâ€™t be blamed for becoming a little paranoid.  Swearing to never again be helpless in the face of an enemy he delved into books and simulations, seeking to learn everything possible about planetary defense.  Still afraid for his safety, Bgeeep then turned his study to covert defenses.

Using this knowledge Bgeeep has developed the most elaborate set of defensive installations ever encountered. Taking active part in all his defensive preparations Bgeeep swears he will never again be afraid.  But he is willing to give his designs to any civilization willing to harbor him.  After all, there is safety in numbers.
