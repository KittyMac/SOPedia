Ultimate: Morph's advanced communications technology allows the command of fleets in transit. This is a risky endeavor and can sometimes result in unforeseen consequences.

When only a young child the Draske known as Morph gained widespread attention when he hacked into the main government computer system and played a Hegemony-wide video. Though it took a year Morph was eventually taken into custody, where his mother, the Matriarch, ordered he be trained for the good of the Hegemony.

Showing a natural talent for communications, Morph created the most sophisticated command and control system in the galaxy.  Allowing easier communication with fewer overheads, the system enables quick fleet coordination, even while traveling at FTL speeds.  Though loyal to the Hegemony, Morph wants to be known as the best communications engineer in the galaxy, and is willing to sell his system to anyone willing to give him the limelight.
