Planet: +50% population growth
Empire: Allows your empire to build Cloning Centers. Cloning is 50% more effective.
Ultimate: Xin-Krek and her children excavate vast underground caverns, raising the max population of the planet to Gaia (will collapse if moved)

The queen of her race, Xin-krek has laid countless eggs over her thousand-year lifetime.  While she would prefer to live untouched by the universe around her, at peace in her underground kingdom, she knows to do so would only invite extinction.  To ensure her children spread across the galaxy she is willing to lend her knowledge to those who know how to ask for it.

An expert in reproduction, even in other species, she knows what it takes to successfully raise young ones.  But, knowing that other species are not as reproductively viable as herself, Xin-Krek has also developed alternative ways of growing populations.  Using both refined reproduction methods and cloning technology Xin-Krek will quickly grow any population to the appropriate levels.
