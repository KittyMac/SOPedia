Planet: +2 food per farmer
System: Biorich Fungi (+4 food per planet)
Ultimate: +1 food per farmer; Paramecium's special food halves the cost of freighting food and doubles the revenue received from excess food sales

Proving that evolution has no limits to its strangeness Director Paramecium and the Harge closely resemble terrestrial slugs.  When the Draske first discovered the Harge home world they thought the rolling fields of grain were somehow a natural phenomenon.  After a surprising first contact the Draske incorporated the Harge Commune into the Hegemony, and both have benefited from the union.

Director Paramecium is an adept farmer, instinctively knowing what each plant needs to reach its maximum potential.  Its body also excretes a powerful chemical that naturally encourages plant growth.  Using both these methods it increases not only the yield, but also the quality of the harvest, and restaurants throughout the galaxy eagerly pay huge premiums to get the bounty on their tables.  But, despite being a client member of the Hegemony, all Director Paramecium wants to do is grow green things, and it will do so for any civilization willing to offer it free reign.
