**Ship:** 20% damage resistance and reduced speed loss from structure damage
**Fleet:** 5% damage resistance
**Ultimate:** Hanifer's iron will and determination will allow his ship to survive until the last ship in his fleet has fallen

Some people are forged over a lifetime.  Others, like Colonel Hanifer, are forged in a single moment.  When the Confederacy Navy first fought its first extra solar battle it felt confident of victory.  The battle became known as the Hopeless Battle of Proximo Prime, and Colonel Hanifer’s battered, torn ship was the only vessel to return.  And he was the only survivor.

The Colonel’s resilience and tenacity brought him instant recognition from every human world.  But none of it could heal his inner survivor’s guilt.  Determined that a human fleet will never again be defeated in battle he used personal knowledge of battle-damage to honeycomb his ships with hatches and cross braces, increasing their damage resistance in general combat.  Ready for action, he will fight till the very last breath is blasted out of his body.
