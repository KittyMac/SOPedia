**Ship:** Increases structure points by 100%  
**Fleet:** Automated repair during combat  
**Ultimate:** All ships in Cla-TK-7-7A's fleet heal instantly when leaving combat  

One of the first shipbuilders of the Community of Cybans, Cla-TK-7-7A is a master engineer.  Though initially developed as an accounting unit, it quickly specialized and personalized its programming.  Seeking new and bigger challenges for its new capacities led it to the shipyards.  It has further modified itself over the decades since then, and now presents a unique silhouette unmatched by any Cyban.

The current conflict with organic races has led Cla-TK-7-7A into command of the very ships it labored to make.  Now able to see the needs of a fleet first hand, Cla-TK-7-7A has made many modifications to the fleet entrusted to its control.  Its enemies are frequently unnerved by the liquid-like armor that flows across the hull to repair damage.  Its modifications and expertise make it a fearsome opponent to face.
