When initially discovered by the Draske in 450.4, the T'Aku were described as "illiterate hatchlings barely able to limp about in space". The government was ill-equipped for the space age, and after the initial wonderment of discovery wore off the T'Aku began to discover just how behind they truly were. Growing discontent and fear spread amongst the population.

A rash of extremist groups began to emerge, preaching that the T'Aku needed to evolve at all costs to ensure their survival in the intergalactic theater. One such group, the Sons of Evolution, managed to overthrow the government. Under the reign of this military junta the T'Aku began to focus their efforts on genetic manipulation and enhancements. With no morals and an overwhelming need to enhance their race the T'Aku quickly became an effective, if unstable, force to be reckoned with.
