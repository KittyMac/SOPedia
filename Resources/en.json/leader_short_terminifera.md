Though technologically backwards Overlord Terminifera’s species were rapid breeders, colonizing vast stretches of the galaxy at the height of their empire.  This proved their undoing, as their seed ships encroached on the territory of less-than-friendly civilizations.

Overlord Terminifera longs for a return to the old days of power, but knows his species cannot survive on its own.  If a civilization will protect his people than he will give them his people’s secrets to rapid growth.  There is safety in numbers, and Terminifera can guarantee any empire the right numbers.
