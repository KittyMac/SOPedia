Many thousands of years ago a group of individuals from a long-forgotten race were sent to colonize another star system.  With faulty navigation and no cryogenics the ship drifted through the cosmos.  Evolving to exist in a weightless environment their brains grew while their limbs withered away. When the Vass Collective found their ship as it drifted past their home world the two groups of beings recognized a kindred spirit in each other.  The Vass incorporated them into the Collective, where they became known as the Cerebrums.

Gaining access to the new technology offered by the Vass unleashed the potential of the Cerebrums.  Under the organization of their leader, the First Cerebrum, they developed new methods of research and development.  Able to make leaps and bounds past traditional methods of thinking the First Cerebrum ensures that the fleet is equipped with beyond-cutting-edge technology.
